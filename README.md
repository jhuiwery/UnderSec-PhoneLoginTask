# UnderSec-Login

A modern, minimalist login security simulation lab designed for cybersecurity training and UI/UX exploration.

## 🚀 Overview

**UnderSec-Login** is a high-fidelity "shooting range" (靶场) for simulating mobile OTP (One-Time Password) login flows. It provides a safe environment for students and security enthusiasts to practice identifying login patterns, testing UI vulnerabilities, or simply exploring modern authentication interfaces.

## ✨ Features

- **Modern Minimalist UI**: Crafted with Tailwind CSS and Framer Motion for a premium, responsive experience.
- **OTP Simulation**: Realistic "Get Code" flow with a 60-second countdown and simulated network latency.
- **Security Hint System**: A built-in debug tooltip (bottom-right) to reveal the generated OTP for testing purposes.
